{"name":"keystone-voms","tagline":"Keystone VOMS authentication module","body":"# Keystone VOMS authentication module\r\n\r\nThis module is intended to provide VOMS authentication to a Grizzly\r\nOpenStack Keystone. It is designed to be integrated as an external\r\nauthentication plugin, so that Keystone will preserve its original\r\nfeatures and users will still be able to authenticate using any of the\r\nKeystone native mechanisms.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be read [online in readthedocs.org](https://keystone-voms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\n\r\nThis module is a WSGI middleware that will provide VOMS authentication into OpenStack Keystone as a external authentication plugin. With this module it is possible to:\r\n\r\n* As a resource provider, enable users from a given VO to get access to a OpenStack installation.\r\n* As a user, use the VOMS credentials to authenticate against a VOMS aware OpenStack cloud using the standard tools, without any modifications (using the [VOMS authentication plugin](https://github.com/IFCA/voms-auth-system-openstack)).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
