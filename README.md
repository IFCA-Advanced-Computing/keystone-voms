Keystone VOMS authentication module
===================================

This module is intended to provide VOMS authentication to a Grizzly
OpenStack Keystone. It is designed to be integrated as an external
authentication plugin, so that Keystone will preserve its original
features and users will still be able to authenticate using any of the
Keystone native mechanisms.

The documentation (the source is in ``doc/source/``) is online at
[Keystone VOMS documentation](https://keystone-voms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

If you are using it, it would be nice that you add your site to the
[Sites Using It](https://github.com/IFCA/keystone-voms/wiki/SitesUsingIt) wiki page.

If you are interested in running the unit test, check the ``TESTING.md``
file for instructions.
